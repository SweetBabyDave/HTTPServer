        <h2>
            Phase 0: Requirements Specification
        </h2>

        
            I need to write a website for a fictional client that allows them to write their own blog. This website will have an about section featuring the client. It will also have CSS Tips as well. This program is aimed to generate a level of familiarity with HTML.

            <h3>Good Solution</h3>

                A good solution has all of the sections clearly labeling and links to each of them. The CSS and CSS- page look very similar, if not the same, with helpful information about CSS. There are pictures in the about section, and clearly labelled blog posts in the blog section. There are also no errors when ran through the validators. 

            <h3>Challenges</h3>

                One challenge I see is creating all of the different styles for the CSS- page. It seems tedious and it might get messy with some of the errors seen in the validator. Making sure that I understand that information will be key when I am writing up the document.

            <h3>Knowns</h3>

                I already know how to write basic HTML, so getting all of the text on the page should be pretty easy.


        <h2>
            Phase 1: System Analysis
        </h2>

        
            <h3>Data</h3>

                The only real information is coming from the hyperlinks to take us over to other pages. This information comes from relative URLs that are just locally on my computer. There also is supposed to be a CSS document that gives style to most of the other HTML documents.

            <h3>Output</h3>

                The output will be an HTML document. It looks like a regular blog website.

            <h3>Algorithms</h3>

                It is mostly just basic HTML with styling preferences and editing text. I will use HTML elements and character entities, along with CSS selectors and properties.

        <h2>
            Phase 2: Design
        </h2>
        
            There are not any functions that are used in the making of this assignment. I am just going to be using the HTML elements and character entities. If you want to know more about some of those, then please see my future CSS pages, they will be explained there.

            <h3>Visuals</h3>

                The blog page will be a generic blog post with text on it, lists, and titles of blog posts. The about page will be 3 pictures with text below each of them. The text will be the gap between each picture. The CSS pages will be text with a lot of lists that are zebra colored. It will also have a different background color for the text. There will also be hyperlinks between pages at the top of each page. These are relative hyperlinks and are on my computer locally.

            <h3>CSS</h3>

                I will have a CSS style file that just states how the header will look, how the lists will look, and how the background will look.

        <h2>
            Phase 3: Implementation
        </h2>
        
            There really is no code to write for this section. I feel like if I write any html here, it would look similar to my actual html implementation.

        <h2>
            Phase 4: Testing and Debugging
        </h2>
        
            I have ran my documents through the HTML and CSS validator a lot as I have written up the blog. The most common errors were:

        <ul>
            <li>There is a ending &lt;/p&gt; without a &lt;p&gt; element in scope.</li>
            <li>There are multiple uses of the #id when there should only be one.</li>
        </ul>
        
            For the first one, so long as I made sure that the p element was used a little more liberally at the beginning and end of multiple paragraphs, it helped to fix the error. The next one I couldn't figure out, but as long as I only used one instance of the id, the error was fixed. If you want to run the tests just go to:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/#file">HTML Validator</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS Validator</a></li>
            </ul>

        <h2>
            Phase 5: Deployment
        </h2>

            I turned in the zip file and made sure that each of the files were properly named.

        <h2>
            Phase 6: Maintenance
        </h2>

            What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
            <ul>
                <li>The techtips-css page is difficult to understand because of all of the text that is required for the styling.</li>
            </ul>
            
            Are there parts of your program which you aren’t quite sure how/why they work?
            <ul>
                <li>I don't exactly understand the #id of the CSS selectors. I used it, but I never understood why if I used it multiple times it would give me an error. Which is why I only used it once.</li>
            </ul>
        
            If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
            <ul>
                <li>I would be able to find the cause pretty rapidly. I would say 30 minutes or less.</li>
            </ul>
            
            Will your documentation make sense to anybody besides yourself?    
            <ul>
                <li>The techtips-css page is difficult to understand because of all of the text that is required for the styling. It wouldn't be too terrible though.</li>
            </ul>
        
            yourself in six month’s time?   
            <ul>
                <li>Definitely, it's not too much to look at.</li>
            </ul>
        
            How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?    
            <ul>
                <li>It would be extremely easy.</li>
            </ul>
        
            Will your program continue to work after upgrading
                your computer’s hardware?
            <ul>
                <li>Definitely.</li>
            </ul>
           
                the operating system?   
            <ul>
                <li>Definitely.</li>
            </ul>
         
                to the next version of Python? 
            <ul>
                <li>Definitely.</li>
            </ul>
