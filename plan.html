        <h2>
            Phase 0: Requirements Specification
        </h2>

            I need to create a server for the blog that I created in the last assignment. I need to add a few more dynamic pages to the website. I also need to work with HTTP Headers and requests to make sure my websites are all valid.

            <h3>Good Solution</h3>

                A good solution will handle all of the client errors in writing the address for the webpage they want to go to. It will have all of the headers and requests required in the assignment documentation.

            <h3>Challenges</h3>

                One challenge I can see is creating the dynamic webpages. It seems difficult to create a page as the user visits the website and not have it already created.

            <h3>Knowns</h3>

                I didn't know a lot of the information to this assignment before starting, but I know how to write the basic HTML for the dynamic webpage creation. From class, I know slightly how to create HTTP requests, but I'm going to need to do some research on HTTP requests. I will also need to look into the http.server library as well.

        <h2>
            Phase 1: System Analysis
        </h2>

            <h3>Data</h3>

                There is information coming from the directory to take us over to other pages. There are HTML documents, jpgs, etc. in the directory. There also is supposed to be a CSS document that gives style to most of the other HTML documents.

            <h3>Output</h3>

                The output will be an HTML document. It looks like a regular blog website. This blog website will be on a HTTP server.

            <h3>Algorithms</h3>

                There will be a function that completes a GET request. A function that completes the HTTP headers. And another function that opens files.

        <h2>
            Phase 2: Design
        </h2>

            <h3>Visuals</h3>

                Since this part is coming mostly from the last assignment, this will the same with a few added HTML pages. The blog page will be a generic blog post with text on it, lists, and titles of blog posts. The about page will be 3 pictures with text below each of them. The text will be the gap between each picture. The CSS pages will be text with a lot of lists that are zebra colored. It will also have a different background color for the text. There will also be hyperlinks between pages at the top of each page. These are relative hyperlinks and are on my computer locally.

            <h3>CSS</h3>

                I will have a CSS style file that just states how the header will look, how the lists will look, and how the background will look.

            <h3>HTTP Requests</h3>

                I will have functions that handle the HTTP Requests of the client. I am going to be using the wfile.write() function to write the information.

            <h3>HTTP Response</h3>

                I will have a function that handles the HTTP Response of the server. Looking over the assigned document, I will use the send_response() function in the server class.

        </h2>
        
            I have ran netcat for this server a lot to try and understand the server. The most common errors were:

        <ul>
            <li>Incorrect headers</li>
            <li>Downloading the file when I wanted it to display</li>
            <li>The page not loading because of incorrect bytes for the headers</li>
        </ul>

            If you would like to test that the server operates correctly, I would recommend starting it and using netcat. If you go to your terminal while the server is running, just run "nc localhost 8000". Then type in "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1". Then press enter twice and you can see your headers for that page and the html of the page.

            What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
            <ul>
                <li>I would say my do_GET() is not the best. It has a lot of HTML and elif statements to redirect to the correct pages. It seems a little funky.</li>
            </ul>
            
            Are there parts of your program which you aren’t quite sure how/why they work?
            <ul>
                <li>The do_HEAD() is a little confusing to me. The send_response() never made a whole lot of sense to me, it seems like it was an initializing header.</li>
            </ul>
        
            If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
            <ul>
                <li>It would take me awhile if it was in the do_GET() method, but if it was in the other 2 methods then I would be able to find it quickly.</li>
            </ul>
            
            Will your documentation make sense to anybody besides yourself?    
            <ul>
                <li>I think the do_GET would be confusing to someone else.</li>
            </ul>
        
            yourself in six month’s time?   
            <ul>
                <li>I would have to take some time to relook it over in 6 months.</li>
            </ul>
        
            How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?    
            <ul>
                <li>It wouldn't be that bad. I think it would be pretty easy because there's not a whole lot of code.</li>
            </ul>
        
            Will your program continue to work after upgrading
                your computer’s hardware?
            <ul>
                <li>Definitely.</li>
            </ul>
           
                the operating system?   
            <ul>
                <li>Definitely.</li>
            </ul>
         
                to the next version of Python? 
            <ul>
                <li>Definitely.</li>
